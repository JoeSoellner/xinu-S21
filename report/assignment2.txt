Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why?
- Somewhat, it seems there are some sort of concurrency issues that are jumbling the output of the program.
- It is mostly readable. There is also sometimes an extra 'xsh' in the middle of the output.

Are all the produced values getting consumed? Check your program for a small count like 20.
- No, some values are not being consumed.
